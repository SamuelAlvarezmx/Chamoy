##Summary

Refactoring code is a common practice because there are sometimes that code can be more easier and therefore faster, there is no need to go through the same amount of loops or some data changed. The advantages of refactoring is that you have the felxibility to get the results that you are looking for. More efficiency or faster procedures. Disadvantages can be also that understanding the code of someone else is not very clear and maybe some lines of code that you think are not essential for the whole subroutine may not be true in the end. Also, refactoring can change completely the purpose of the first one.
In this particular case, I think the main cons is that we are using more variables, is not as straight forward as the first subroutine made. If you are not following correctly your steps it might get confusing while refactoring.

The pros is that with all these new variables and arrays I think the subroutine has more flexibility, even if the data gets bigger. Also it is important organizing the information in arrays, letting the program run faster through the lines of code. It is seen in the comparison of the time it takes to run the code between the refactored and the original one.
